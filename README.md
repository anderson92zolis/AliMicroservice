Microservices with Spring Boot 3

This project is  to discover the power of microservices architecture where we are going to built and deploy, and scaling modern applications. I'll explore essential concepts such as API Gateway, Config Server, Discovery Server, and hands-on implementation of two real-world microservices, Student and School.

##  Key Features


- **Microservices Fundamentals:** Gain a deep understanding of microservices architecture and its advantages over traditional monolithic applications.

- **API Gateway:** Implement an API Gateway to centralize and manage requests, offering a unified entry point for your microservices ecosystem.

- **Config Server:** Utilize a Config Server for centralized configuration management, simplifying application maintenance and ensuring consistency across environments.

- **Discovery Server:** Leverage a Discovery Server for efficient service registration and discovery, enabling seamless communication between microservices.

- **Practical Microservices:** Develop two practical microservices, Student and School, to learn the intricacies of designing and building modular services.

- **Communication with OpenFeign:** Explore communication between microservices using OpenFeign, a user-friendly, declarative REST client.

- **Distributed Tracing with Zipkin:** Enhance application observability and debugging with distributed tracing using Zipkin, allowing you to visualize and troubleshoot latency issues.

- **Production Best Practices:** Learn best practices for securing, monitoring, and deploying microservices in production environments.
